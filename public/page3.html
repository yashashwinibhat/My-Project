      Dont be too hard on yourself. The phrase 'do your best' is something you are likely to hear a lot when you grow up. But many of us come to struggle with a serious case of being too hard on ourselves, which is not so surprising. Remember that you are only a human and failure is part and parcel of life. But taking care of your gut is equally important to ensure you have a healthy balance of micro and macronutrients, by intaking fruits and vegetables that are anti-inflammatory.
      Apart from eating healthy food you should also exercise enough atleast 30 minutes every day. If you are unable to step out of the house, you can do indoor exercises. Get good quality of sleep and take out some time for yourself by meditating or by doing things that rejuvenate you. Stay fit stay happy.</div></p>
